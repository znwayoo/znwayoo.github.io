# Customer Analytics Dashboard

Understanding customer behavior is the key to improving product retention. In this project, I engineered a robust data pipeline that ingests events from multiple sources and funnels them into a unified data warehouse for analysis.

## The Challenge
Our primary challenge was dealing with disconnected data silos. Marketing data lived in HubSpot, product events in Mixpanel, and billing in Stripe. We needed a single source of truth.

## The Solution
I built a data pipeline using **Python** and **FastAPI** to extract and transform the data, loading it into a central PostgreSQL database using **SQL**. The final visualization layer was built in **Tableau**.

### Key Features:
- Real-time customer churn prediction
- Cohort analysis by acquisition channel
- Automated weekly reporting to stakeholders

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/api/cohorts")
def get_cohort_data():
    # Example snippet for cohort extraction
    df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM cohorts", engine)
    return df.to_dict(orient="records")
```

## Results
The dashboard reduced time-to-insight for the product team from 3 days to instantaneous, directly contributing to a 15% increase in targeted customer retention campaigns.
