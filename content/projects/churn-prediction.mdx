# Predictive Churn Modeling

Retaining an existing customer is significantly cheaper than acquiring a new one. This project focuses on identifying "at-risk" customers before they cancel their subscriptions.

## Approach
Using historical usage patterns, support ticket frequency, and login cadence, I trained a Random Forest classifier.

### Tech Stack
- **scikit-learn** for modeling and hyperparameter tuning
- **MLflow** for tracking experiments and model registry
- **PostgreSQL** for feature store

```sql
-- Feature Extraction Query
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_logins,
    MAX(event_date) as last_login,
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM (CURRENT_DATE - MAX(event_date))) as days_since_last_login
FROM 
    user_events
GROUP BY 
    user_id;
```

## Business Impact
By feeding the model's predictions directly back into our CRM, the Customer Success team was able to proactively reach out to at-risk accounts, saving an estimated $200k in ARR over a single quarter.
